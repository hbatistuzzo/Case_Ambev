# The Case

Given the `dataset.json` file which contains the orders made by customers in one of Ambev's applications, the Case establish objective questions to be answered.
Besides an initial inspection, this project will follow the structured path provided by the questions themselves.

## Initial inspection

---

## Case questions

- List as many use cases for the dataset as possible.
	- Recommendation system
	- Which channel sells the most 

- Pick one of the use cases you listed in question 1 and describe how building a statistical model based on the dataset could best be used to improve the business this data comes from.

- Implement the model you described in question 2, preferably in Python. The code has to retrieve the data, train and test a statistical model, and report relevant performance criteria.
Ideally, we should be able to replicate your analysis from your submitted source-code, so please explicit the versions of the tools and packages you are using.

- Explain each and every of your design choices, you can use jupyter notebooks. (e.g., preprocessing, model selection, hyper parameters, evaluation criteria). Compare and contrast your choices with alternative methodologies.

- Describe how you would improve the model in Question 3 if you had more time.
